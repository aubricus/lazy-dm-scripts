# Lazy DM Scripts

Simple Python scripts to generate:

* Names
* Items
* Traps
* Monsters

Inspired by content from the [Return of the Lazy DM](https://slyflourish.com/returnofthelazydm/) from [Sky Flourish](https://skyflourish.com). 

## Usage

These are fairly standard Python scripts that can be run in the standard fashion:

```python
# python SCRIPT_FILE_NAME [OPTIONS...]
# For example

python random_item.py

# Run --help on any of the scripts to see help text
python random_item.py --help
```
